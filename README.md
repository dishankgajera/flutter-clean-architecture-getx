# 🚀 flutter-clean-architecture-getx

A **scalable** and **testable** Flutter boilerplate using **Clean Architecture** and **GetX**.

This repository provides a reference architecture for Flutter projects following Clean Architecture principles with GetX for state management, routing, and dependency injection. It's ideal for MVPs, production apps, and modular Flutter development.

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- ✅ **GetX** for state management, navigation, and dependency injection
- ✅ **Clean Architecture** layered approach:
  - **Data** (models, sources, repositories)
  - **Domain** (entities, use cases, contracts)
  - **Presentation** (UI, controllers, bindings)
- ✅ **Feature-first folder structure**
- ✅ Scalable and easy-to-test architecture
- ✅ Uses `Get.lazyPut` and `Get.find()` for dependency injection
